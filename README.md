# CodeClauseInternship_Customer_Segmentation_System
An Intriguing Machine Learning Project as part of an Internship.

The Customer Segmentation System is a data-driven project that uses K-Means clustering and other unsupervised learning approaches to divide customers into different categories according to their behavior, preferences, and past purchases. With the help of this initiative, businesses will be able to develop targeted marketing plans, personalize the experiences of their customers, and enhance product suggestions.

Key Steps:
- Data Collection: The project starts with the collection of customer data, which may include information such as demographics, transaction history, and website interactions. This dataset serves as the foundation for the segmentation analysis.

- Data Preprocessing: Before applying clustering algorithms, data preprocessing is performed to handle missing values, scale features, and ensure the dataset.

- K-Means Clustering: K-Means clustering is applied to the preprocessed data. The algorithm groups customers into clusters based on their similarity, aiming to minimize the within-cluster variation.

- Optimal Cluster Number: The Elbow Method or Silhouette Score may be used to determine the optimal number of clusters. This helps in defining the granularity of segmentation.

- Customer Segmentation: After clustering, each customer is assigned to one of the clusters. This results in distinct customer segments, each characterized by its unique traits and behaviors.

- Insights and Actionable Results: The segmented groups are analyzed to derive actionable insights. Businesses can tailor marketing campaigns, product recommendations, and customer engagement strategies for each segment to maximize their impact.

- Visualization: Data visualizations, such as scatter plots or bar charts, are created to illustrate the boundaries and characteristics of each customer segment.
