An Intriguing Machine Learning Project as part of an Internship.

The Gender and Age Detection System is a deep learning project that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze images of human faces and make predictions about the gender and age of the individuals in those images. This system is designed to automate the process of determining demographic information from visual data and has various practical applications, such as marketing analytics, content personalization, and security.

Key features:

Dataset The project usually begins with a list of facial images, with the personâ€™s gender (e.g., male or female) and age (e.g., child, adolescent, adult, adult). ) have documented each.
Data preprocessing: Data preprocessing includes such tasks as resizing images, changing pixel values, and enlarging the data set to increase model performance
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): CNN is the main component of the modeling algorithm. It is designed to recognize sequences from images, capturing patterns and information important for sex and age prediction
Model training: The data set is divided into training and testing. The CNN model is trained on a training set, where it learns how to model image features according to sex and age. Loss functions and evaluation criteria (e.g., accuracy) are used to measure the performance of the model.
Callbacks: Callbacks such as EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau can be used to monitor and improve the training.
Prediction: Once a model is trained and tested, it can be used to predict new unseen images. These predictors include gender (male or female) and age (e.g., 20-30 years).
Visualization: Visualization techniques such as confusion matrices or bar charts can be used to check the accuracy and performance of the model.
